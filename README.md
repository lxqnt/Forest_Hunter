## Forest Hunter: Raycasting in C

Continuing an exploration of computer graphics in C, I dived into raycasting with this project while using the famous wolfenstein 3d as a guide. 

## Installation

Clone the repository and run 'make' from the command line within the project folder. 

The project relies on two seperate libraries - libft and minilibx - which will also compile at the same time.
